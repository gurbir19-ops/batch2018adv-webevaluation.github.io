<i><h2 style="color:red">Games are sometimes played purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well.<br> They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals.<br> The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship.<br> On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play.<br> Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.<br></h2></i>
